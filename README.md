design of states was done in /home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/des1/ and des2

the folders should have xmls

i at some point extended the helix using /home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/ext_hlx/extend_hlx.ipynb

but that can probably be done better

loops as before, just make sure to connect the right termini, and always carry the helix along

for state X, need to paste helix in there and yeet

/home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/msd1/msd_scripts/msd_fnr.py

is nonpolar interface

I tried designing with polars, /home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/msd3_pol/msd_scripts/msd_fnr.py allows polars, while

/home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/msd4_pol/msd_scripts/msd_fnr.py

uses constraints to force in polars

forced polars did not look great though

I think in des1 or des2 I allowed polars in the hing-helix interface, but not the hinge-hiknge interface
