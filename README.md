for state X, need to paste helix in there and yeet

/home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/msd1/msd_scripts/msd_fnr.py

is nonpolar interface

I tried designing with polars, /home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/msd3_pol/msd_scripts/msd_fnr.py allows polars, while

/home/flop/switch/5thround/DHRs/allo3/msd4_pol/msd_scripts/msd_fnr.py

uses constraints to force in polars

forced polars did not look great though

I think in des1 or des2 I allowed polars in the hing-helix interface, but not the hinge-hinge interface
